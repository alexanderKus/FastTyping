# How to calculation typing speed (WPM) and accuracy

## Gross WPN

$$
Gross WPN = {({All\ Typed\ Entires \over 5}) \over Time\ (min)}
$$

## Net WPM

$$
Net WPM =
  {Gross\ WPN} - {({Uncorrected\ Errors \over Time\ (min)})} =
  {[{({All\ Typed\ Entires \over 5})} - Uncorrected\ Errors] \over Time\ (min)}
$$
